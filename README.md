# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://recipe-impact-book.firebaseapp.com/>

Recipe Impact Book lets users access recipes by searching for recipe names and viewing their ingredients and instructions on how to make them. Users can then create an account or log in to add or remove them from favorites, view recents, and add/remove recipe ingredients to a list.
